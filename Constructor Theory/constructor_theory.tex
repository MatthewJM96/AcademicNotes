\section*{The Why}
Since physics developed out of natural philosophy, it has presumed a dogma that might be now called the Newtonian framing: identify a rule of how the state of a thing changes into another state, and figure out some fixing of that thing's state at some "time" - concisely: laws of motion and initial conditions. From these two things, with arbitrary precision and (until quantum theory) accuracy we can say how that thing has been throughout its being. Quantum mechanics introduced an uncertainty to this, but that uncertainty may well be a local property of where we are (a modal branch of the universe, or some hidden variables that we have yet to, or cannot determine), and even if not the basic way of thinking about systems in still largely the same.

Aside from these laws of motion and initial conditions, we have had other kinds of laws which simply state certain things are impossible (e.g. conservations/symmetries, 2nd law of thermodynamics, etc.), which in turn give us limits on how efficiently certain processes can occur (e.g. heat exchange). This project seeks to reformulate physics (and perhaps the other sciences) in terms of statements of possible and impossible transformations - with possibility and impossibility used in a binary sense.

To accommodate such a reformulation, constructor theory seeks to provide a framework in which 'subsidiary theories' (specific collections of the above statements of possibility) can be placed. In developing this framework, certain properties immediately fall out which are explored first. So far no subsidiary theories have been written down.

\section{Definitions}

\subsection{Concepts}

\begin{itemize}
	\item[\textbf{Constructor Theory}] The framework of principles that regulate how subsidiary theories can be written.
	\item[\textbf{Subsidiary Theory}] A collection of statements of what transformations are and are not possible, written in constructor-theoretic language.
	\item[\textbf{Substrate}] A system that has state and can cause or react to transformations.
	\item[\textbf{Constructor}] A substrate that facilitates a transformation on other substrates with no change to its own state.
	\item[\textbf{Variable}] A set of disjoint attributes for which a substrate can be in a state with some distribution over these attributes. \textit{Note}: two substrates in combination may have variables (and so attributes) that are not present independently in the two substrates - such as distance between centre of masses.
	\item[\textbf{Attribute}] A property of a substrate, capable of being modified by some transformation. An attribute can be defined as the set of states of a substrate that hold that attribute.
	\item[\textbf{Substrate State}] A set of fixings of variables of the substrate in question.
	\item[\textbf{Sharp Variable}] A variable of which a specific attribute is held in a substrate's state. That is to say, if that variable was measured on that substrate, the specific attribute would be evaluated.
	\item[\textbf{Task}] A transformation that is described by a set of input attributes that map in an ordered fashion to a same-size set of output attributes. A task acts on any substrate with at least one attribute in its state that is indistinguishable from an attribute in the input attributes of the task, and changes that attribute to the corresponding output attribute.
	\item[\textbf{Identity Task}] The task that makes no change to the state of a substrate on which it acts.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mathematical Syntax}

\begin{itemize}
	\item[\textbf{Substrate}] $\textbf{\textsc{S}}$ is the set of all states the substrate can be in (precise definitions from subsidiary theories). Latin alphabet letters in same font are other substrates, $\textbf{\textsc{E}}$ often being used to denote the environment.
	\item[\textbf{Substrate State}] $\textsc{S} \in \textbf{\textsc{S}}$ is a state of a substrate $\textbf{\textsc{S}}$. Latin alphabet letters in same font are other substrate states, except where specified.
	\item[\textbf{Variable}] $X$ is the set of disjoint attributes that make up the variable (precise definitions from subsidiary theories). Upper-case Latin alphabet letters in the same font are other variables, except where specified.
	\item[\textbf{Attribute}] $x \in X$ is an attribute in the variable $X$. An attribute can also be a member of a substrate state: $x \in \textsc{S}$. Lower-case Latin alphabet characters in the same font are other attributes, except where specified.
	\item[\textbf{Task}] $\mathcal{T} = \{\,x_{i} \rightarrow y_{i}\,\}, \ \forall \ i \in \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, N\}$ is a task described by a set of mappings from input attributes to output attributes. In the given definition, $N \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$ is the number of mappings necessary to define the given task. Latin alphabet characters in the same font are other tasks, except where specified.
	We mark a task as possible by writing $\mathcal{T}^{\underline{\text{\cmark}}}$ and likewise a task as impossible by writing $\mathcal{T}^{\underline{\text{\xmark}}}$.
\end{itemize}

Given the above definitions, we can work with multiple substrates, applying composite tasks that act across them. For example, given the tasks $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$, and the substrate states $\textsc{M} \in \textbf{\textsc{M}}$ and $\textsc{N} \in \textbf{\textsc{N}}$ we can write a composite task $$\mathcal{A} \otimes \mathcal{B}$$ and a composite substrate state $$\textsc{M} \oplus \textsc{N} \in \textbf{\textsc{M}} \oplus \textbf{\textsc{N}} \ .$$ The tasks can then act as: $$(\mathcal{A} \otimes \mathcal{B})(\textsc{M} \oplus \textsc{N}) = \mathcal{A}\textsc{M} \oplus \mathcal{B}\textsc{N} \ .$$

\subsection{Some Tasks}

\subsubsection{Reversible Computation Task}

For a substrate state $\textsc{S} \in \textbf{\textsc{S}}$ with at least two attributes $x \in \textsc{S}$ and a permutation $\textsc{\Pi}_{\textsc{S}}(x)$, we define a reversible computation task as:
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{C}_{\Pi}(\textsc{S}) = \underset{x \in \textsc{S}}{\bigcup}\{\,x \rightarrow \textsc{\Pi}_{\textsc{S}}(x)\,\}
\end{equation}This task allows us to define some terms:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[\textbf{Computation Variable}] $\textsc{S}$ is defined as such if ${\mathcal{C}_{\Pi}}^{\underline{\text{\cmark}}} \ \forall \ \textsc{\Pi}_{\textsc{S}}$.
	\item[\textbf{Computation Medium}] as a substrate with at least one computation variable.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Cloning Task}

For a substrate state $\textsc{S} \in \textbf{\textsc{S}}$ with at least two attributes $x \in \textsc{S}$, we can write a cloning task that acts on $ \textbf{\textsc{S}} \oplus \textbf{\textsc{S}}$ as:
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{R}(\textsc{S}, x_0) = \underset{x \in \textsc{S}}{\bigcup}\{\,(x, x_0) \rightarrow (x, x)\,\}
\end{equation}where each $x_0$ is some attribute which can be transformed into the corresponding attribute $x \in \textsc{S}$. The second substrate, whose state is defined by the set of $x_0$, is required to be derived from generic, naturally occurring resources.

This cloning task is a generalisation of total cloning, which would require $\textsc{S}$ be the set of all attributes in $\textbf{\textsc{S}}$. As with the reversible computation task we can introduce some definitions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[\textbf{Clonable State}] $\textsc{S}$ is defined as clonable if $\mathcal{R}(\textsc{S}, x_0)^{\underline{\text{\cmark}}}$.
	\item[\textbf{Clonable Variable}] $X$ is defined as clonable if $\mathcal{R}(X, x_0)^{\underline{\text{\cmark}}}$. (Note that this is okay to write as both a substrate state and a variable are expressed as sets of attributes.)
	\item[\textbf{Information Variable}] $X$ is defined as such if it is a clonable \textit{computation variable}.
	\item[\textbf{Information Attribute}] $x$ is defined as such if $x \in X$, where $X$ is an information variable.
	\item[\textbf{Information Medium}] as a substrate with at least on information variable.
\end{itemize}

\section{Universal Principles}

\begin{itemize}
	\item[\textbf{Counter-factual Nature}] Subsidiary laws are expressed entirely as a collection of statements saying what transformations are and are not possible on system states.
	\item[\textbf{Locality Principle}] A transformation acting on one substrate only affects state on that substrate. That is, for substrates $\textbf{\textsc{S}}_{1}$,  $\textbf{\textsc{S}}_{2}$, with an arbitrary task $\mathcal{A}$, and identity task $\mathcal{I}$:
		\begin{equation}
			\begin{split}
				\forall \ \textsc{S}_{1} \in \textbf{\textsc{S}}_{1}, \ \textsc{S}_{2} \in \textbf{\textsc{S}}_{2} \\
				\textit{state}(\textbf{\textsc{S}}_{1} \oplus \textbf{\textsc{S}}_{2}) = \textsc{S}_{1} \oplus \textsc{S}_{2} \\
				(\mathcal{A} \otimes \mathcal{I})(\textsc{S}_{1} \oplus \textsc{S}_{2}) = \mathcal{A}\textsc{S}_{1} \oplus \ \textsc{S}_{2}
			\end{split}
		\end{equation}
	\item[\textbf{}]
\end{itemize}
